The United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) has again condemned Russia over its invasion of Ukraine, calling for  Moscow’s immediate withdrawal and an end to the fighting.
A year since President Vladimir Putin ordered the invasion, which he has called a “special military operation”, 141 countries backed the resolution calling for a “comprehensive, just and lasting peace” in Ukraine. Thirty-two countries abstained from voting, while seven countries, including Russia, voted against.
Here is a breakdown of how each country voted in the UNGA in New York City on Thursday:
