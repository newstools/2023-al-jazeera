French President Emmanuel Macron is visiting four nations in central Africa.
He’s hoping to regain influence on a continent where the former colonial power now faces competition from other nations, notably China and Russia.
Macron says he wants to reset ties – promising a new partnership of equals.
He’s visiting countries he has not been to before: Gabon, Angola, the Republic of Congo and the Democratic Republic of Congo.
France has announced it’s scaling back its military presence on the continent – pulling out of Mali, the Central African Republic and Burkina Faso, where the government ordered its troops out.
So, can Macron improve relations with African nations?
