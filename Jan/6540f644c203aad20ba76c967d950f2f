Tigray was cut off from the rest of Ethiopia and the outside world for nearly two years. As a civil war raged on, the region was under a de facto blockade that impacted everything from food to phone lines.

But a peace agreement signed between the Ethiopian government and Tigrayan forces in November means the region is beginning to open up again. So what does that mean for the people in Tigray?
