Hopes for peace, or another false dawn?
That’s what people are asking in the Democratic Republic of Congo, where M23 fighters have pledged to leave Rumangabo.
That town is in the east and has a large military base.
But the Congolese army says a similar pledge to quit another strategic town, Kibumba, in December has not been fulfilled.
Conflict has forced many people to flee the region and a UN investigation has documented widespread human rights abuses.
The death toll from violence in the region since the 1990s stands in the millions, according to some estimates.
So what are the prospects for a lasting peace?
